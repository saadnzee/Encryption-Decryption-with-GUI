# RSA-Based Secure Data Handling with GUI (C# and C++)

- This project aims to develop a secure file encryption and decryption system using the RSA algorithm, complemented by a user-friendly graphical interface. The system is designed to handle sensitive information with high security by employing RSA for cryptographic operations.

- RSA Encryption and Decryption:
Utilize the RSA algorithm, a widely-recognized asymmetric encryption technique, to ensure robust data security.
RSA will be employed for encrypting files with a public key and decrypting files with a corresponding private key, providing a secure method for data protection.

- Key Management:
Automatically generate RSA key pairs (public and private keys) essential for the encryption and decryption processes.
Store these RSA keys securely in designated directories to ensure their availability and protection.

- File Handling:
Encryption: When a file is selected for encryption, the system uses the RSA public key to encrypt the file. The encrypted file is then saved in a secure encryption directory.
Decryption: To decrypt, the system retrieves the encrypted file from the directory and uses the RSA private key to restore the original content.

- User Interface:
Develop an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) in C# to facilitate seamless user interaction with the encryption and decryption functions.
The interface will allow users to easily select files, manage RSA keys, and perform encryption or decryption operations.

- Technical Implementation:
Public Key Encryption: Encrypt files using the RSA public key, ensuring that only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt the data.
Private Key Decryption: Decrypt files using the RSA private key, restoring the original data securely.

- C# Application:

- The primary GUI is developed in C# to provide a user-friendly experience. It handles file selection, key management, and integrates with the RSA cryptographic functions implemented in C++.
C++ Library:

- Implement the RSA algorithm in a C++ library, which performs the core cryptographic operations. This library is invoked by the C# application to handle the encryption and decryption tasks.
- Workflow:
- Key Generation:

- Generate RSA key pairs (public and private keys). Store the public key for encryption and the private key for decryption in secure locations.
- Encryption Process:

- Users select a file to encrypt.
- The application uses the RSA public key to encrypt the file and saves the encrypted file in a designated directory.
Decryption Process:

- Users select an encrypted file for decryption.
- The application retrieves the encrypted file and decrypts it using the RSA private key, restoring the file to its original form.
- This approach leverages the RSA algorithm to provide a high level of security for sensitive data, combining C# for the user interface with C++ for the cryptographic implementation.
